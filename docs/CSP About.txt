Christopher S. Penn & Trust Insights
Comprehensive Company Profile, Competitive
Landscape, and Strategic Analysis
Date: December 6, 2025
Distribution: C-Suite / Board of Directors
Classification: Confidential Market Strategy
Subject: Strategic Positioning and Operational Roadmap for Christopher S. Penn (Keynote
Speaker/Thought Leader)

1. Executive Intelligence Summary
The artificial intelligence (AI) and data science services market has undergone a radical phase
transition. Following the explosive democratization of Generative AI (GenAI) in 2023, the
industry has moved from a period of "peak hype" into a phase of rigorous operational
scrutiny. Corporate leadership no longer rewards mere futurism; the market now demands
"engineering-grade" strategy—pragmatic, measurable, and technically sound implementation
frameworks. In this maturing landscape, Christopher S. Penn has carved out a defensible and
highly lucrative niche as the "Chief Data Scientist" of the global speaking circuit. By
positioning himself at the intersection of hard data science and marketing strategy, he has
insulated his brand from the commoditization currently eroding the value of generalist "AI
experts."
This report provides an exhaustive strategic profile of Christopher S. Penn and his associated
consultancy, Trust Insights. The analysis indicates that Penn operates a sophisticated
"flywheel" business model where high-frequency, high-utility content (the Almost Timely
newsletter) drives demand for high-margin consulting and premium keynote speaking
engagements.1 His value proposition is distinct: unlike competitors who focus on the "ethics"
or "philosophy" of AI, Penn focuses on the physics of AI—how models work, how to code
them, and how to govern them with mathematical precision.3
Critical Strategic Findings:
●​ Market Position: Penn is the "Practitioner-Guide." While competitors like Zack Kass
(Ex-OpenAI) trade on "Insider" status 5, and Paul Roetzer (Marketing AI Institute) trades
on "Community," Penn trades on "Competence." He is the expert who opens the terminal
and writes Python code on stage, signaling a level of technical veracity that is rare in the
marketing keynote sector.3

●​ Financial Architecture: The business operates on a tiered revenue model. Keynote fees
have stabilized in the $20,000–$35,000 range for in-person events 6, serving as the
primary cash cow. This is supported by a consulting engine (Trust Insights) that captures
long-tail value through data audits and "fractional data science" retainers.8
●​ Growth Vectors: The strategic roadmap for 2025-2026 relies heavily on "Deep
Research" capabilities—using agentic AI to automate complex intelligence
gathering—and scaling the newsletter subscriber base from ~300,000 to 400,000 to
secure dominance in B2B influence.2
●​ Competitive Moat: Penn’s proprietary "5P Framework" (Purpose, People, Process,
Platform, Performance) has become a standard heuristic for enterprise AI adoption,
creating high switching costs for clients who adopt his methodology.10
This document dissects these elements through twelve distinct strategic lenses, utilizing
SWOT, Porter’s Five Forces, and BCG Matrix frameworks to provide actionable intelligence for
understanding his market dominance.

2. Market Context: The "Intelligence Revolution"
To accurately assess Christopher Penn’s strategic standing, one must first analyze the
macro-economic and technological environment in which he operates. Penn creates his own
nomenclature for this era, termed "The Intelligence Revolution," positioning it as a
socio-economic shift comparable in magnitude to the Industrial Revolution.11 This framing is
not merely rhetorical; it dictates his entire product strategy.

2.1 The Transition from Predictive to Generative to Agentic
The market for AI advisory services has evolved through three distinct epochs in a remarkably
short timeframe:
●​ Epoch 1: Predictive Analytics (Pre-2023): The focus was on "Big Data," regression
analysis, and forecasting. Penn established his early reputation here, leveraging his
background in Google Analytics and statistical modeling.
●​ Epoch 2: Generative Utility (2023-2024): triggered by ChatGPT, the market demanded
immediate "prompt engineering" skills. Penn capitalized on this by releasing courses like
"Generative AI for Marketers" and developing prompt frameworks.3
●​ Epoch 3: Agentic Autonomy (2025-Present): The current market is shifting toward
"Agentic AI"—systems that can reason, plan, and execute multi-step workflows without
human intervention. Penn has pivoted his content aggressively toward this, focusing on
"Deep Research" agents and "Knowledge Blocks".9
Strategic Implication: The speed of this transition has decimated the business models of
"static" consultants. Penn’s ability to "live code" and adapt his curriculum weekly (e.g.,

integrating DeepSeek R1 or Gemini 2.5 immediately upon release) allows him to maintain
relevance where static certification bodies fail.3

2.2 The "Lemon Market" of AI Expertise
The barrier to entry for claiming "AI Expertise" collapsed in 2023. LinkedIn and conference
circuits became flooded with self-proclaimed experts, creating an information asymmetry
known in economics as a "Lemon Market" (Akerlof). Buyers (C-Suite executives and Event
Planners) struggle to distinguish between genuine experts and those merely regurgitating
press releases.
In this environment, provenance becomes the ultimate differentiator. Penn leverages his
history—starting in AI/ML in 2013, a decade before the hype cycle—as a primary trust signal.1
He reinforces this by "showing his work," frequently publishing the actual code, raw data, and
prompts used to generate his insights. This "radical transparency" functions as a signaling
mechanism: only a true expert would risk exposing their raw methodology to public scrutiny.15

2.3 The "Move 37" Moment for Knowledge Workers
A recurring theme in the broader industry, echoed by competitors like Paul Roetzer, is the
"Move 37" moment (referencing AlphaGo’s move against Lee Sedol)—the realization that AI is
now superhuman at specific cognitive tasks.16 This creates existential dread among
knowledge workers. Penn addresses this not with platitudes but with a survival strategy: "The
Most Best." He argues that in a world of infinite AI content, the only winning strategy is to be
the outlier—the "most best"—because average is now free.11 This narrative resonates deeply
with anxious professional audiences who need a roadmap for survival, not just a tech demo.

3. Customer Segments and Market Penetration
The audience for Christopher Penn and Trust Insights is not monolithic. It is segmented into
distinct psychological and functional profiles, each requiring a tailored value proposition.

3.1 Primary Segment: The "Anxious Executive" (Strategic Buyer)
●​ Profile: CMOs, CDOs, and VPs of Marketing at mid-to-large enterprises ($50M - $1B
revenue).
●​ Psychographics: They are overwhelmed by the velocity of AI change. They face
pressure from the Board to "do AI" but fear the risks of data leakage ("Shadow AI") and
copyright infringement.
●​ Buying Trigger: They need governance and clarity. They are not looking for a tutorial on
how to write a prompt; they are looking for a strategic framework to deploy AI safely
across 500 employees.

●​ Penn’s Appeal: The 5P Framework (Purpose, People, Process, Platform, Performance).
By framing AI as a process and people challenge rather than just a tech challenge, Penn
speaks the language of management. He provides the "cover" an executive needs to
justify AI investment.10

3.2 Secondary Segment: The "Technical Practitioner" (Operational
Buyer)
●​ Profile: Marketing Operations Managers, Data Analysts, SEO Specialists, Content
Directors.
●​ Psychographics: "Proud Nerds." They enjoy the technical weeds. They are skeptical of
fluff. They follow Penn because he validates their technical curiosity.
●​ Buying Trigger: They need tactical skills to survive automation. They buy the $799
courses and advocate for Penn as the keynote speaker at their company offsite.
●​ Penn’s Appeal: He respects their intelligence. He explains the vector math. He shares
the Python scripts. He validates that "Generative AI sucks at math" 4, gaining credibility
by acknowledging tool limitations.

3.3 Tertiary Segment: The "Event Curator" (Channel Partner)
●​ Profile: Conference organizers (e.g., Social Media Marketing World, MAICON, INBOUND).
●​ Priorities: They need speakers who are "safe" (won't say anything PR-damaging),
reliable (show up on time), and highly rated by audiences.
●​ Penn’s Appeal: He is a known quantity with a massive "owned audience" (newsletter)
that he can leverage to help market the event. His "Edutainment" style—high energy,
rapid-fire slides, live demos—guarantees high audience scores.1

4. Comprehensive Services Portfolio Analysis
Penn’s revenue architecture is a sophisticated ecosystem where low-cost/free content feeds
high-margin services. This structure maximizes "Customer Lifetime Value" (CLV) by capturing
value at every stage of the buyer's journey.

4.1 The "Almost Timely" Newsletter (The Top of Funnel)
Role: Lead Generation & Brand Loyalty.
●​ Scale: Approximately 300,000 subscribers, with a stated strategic goal to reach
400,000 by Q1 2026.2
●​ Content Strategy: The newsletter is not merely a digest; it is a "weekly masterclass." It
typically includes a "Cold Open" editorial, a deep-dive technical essay (e.g., "How to
Code with AI"), and curated links.
●​ Monetization:
○​ Sponsorships: Premium ad spots are valued highly (e.g., a dedicated spot for

United24 valued at $25,000/quarter implies high CPM rates for commercial
sponsors).17
○​ Data Product: Penn uses the newsletter as a dataset to train his own AI models,
gaining insights into audience behavior that informs his consulting.18

4.2 Keynote Speaking (The Cash Cow)
Role: High Margin Revenue & Authority Building.
●​ Fee Structure:
○​ In-Person (Domestic): $20,000 - $30,000.6
○​ In-Person (International): $35,000+ (inferred from travel premiums and market
rates).
○​ Virtual: $10,000 - $20,000.6
●​ Differentiation: Penn’s keynotes are distinct products.
○​ The Intelligence Revolution: Macro-trends for leadership audiences.
○​ Winning as a Human: Motivational focus for general audiences.
○​ The Marketing Singularity: A specialized track for marketing conferences.1
●​ Strategic Pricing: His pricing places him in the "Premium Expert" tier—above the $10k
generalists but accessible compared to the $50k-$100k "Celebrity" tier (e.g., Zack Kass,
Gary Vaynerchuk).5 This "upper-middle" positioning maximizes volume while maintaining
prestige.

4.3 Trust Insights Consulting (The Long Tail)
Role: Recurring Revenue & Deep Implementation.
●​ Service Lines:
○​ Management Consulting: Retainer-based advisory services for AI strategy,
governance, and organizational change.8
○​ Data Audits ("Mise en Place"): Technical cleanup of GA4, SQL databases, and CRM
data to prepare for AI.
○​ Custom AI Development: Building private instances of LLMs or RAG
(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for clients who cannot use public
ChatGPT.8
●​ Unique Selling Proposition (USP): "We show you the math." Trust Insights differentiates
by delivering transparency, unlike "Black Box" agencies that hoard the methodology.

4.4 Digital Academy & Workshops (The Scalable Middle)
Role: Passive Income & Training.
●​ Products: "Generative AI for Marketers" Course ($799), "Google Analytics 4 for
Marketers".20
●​ Workshops: 1-2 day intensives (e.g., "Generative AI: The London Workshop"). These

allow Penn to monetize the "do-it-yourself" crowd who cannot afford full consulting but
have budget for training.21

5. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) & Vertical Analysis
Based on the synthesis of speaking engagements and case studies, the Ideal Customer Profile
for Christopher Penn and Trust Insights has crystallized into specific verticals.

5.1 Industry Verticals
1.​ B2B Technology & SaaS: High demand for "Thought Leadership" and advanced data
analytics. Companies like Cisco, Citrix, and McAfee are cited as past
clients/engagements.1
2.​ Regulated Industries (Finance/Healthcare): These sectors have high data privacy
needs. They cannot simply "use ChatGPT." They require the governance and private
cloud expertise that Penn offers.
3.​ Associations & Non-Profits: Professional associations (e.g., SMPS, MASFAA) frequently
book him to help their members understand industry shifts. Penn offers a 50% discount
to 501(c)(3)s, a strategic move that builds goodwill and volume.6

5.2 The "Data-Savvy" Maturity Curve
Penn utilizes a maturity model to qualify clients:
1.​ Data-Resistant: Not a target.
2.​ Data-Curious: Target for newsletters/books.
3.​ Data-Aware: Target for workshops/courses.
4.​ Data-Savvy: Target for consulting retainers.
5.​ Data-Driven: Target for custom AI development partnerships.23
The strategic goal is to move clients "up the ladder." A client might enter as a "Data-Curious"
newsletter subscriber, attend a "Data-Aware" workshop, and eventually sign a "Data-Savvy"
consulting contract.

6. Customer Priorities and Decision Drivers
The modern buyer of AI services is driven by three conflicting priorities: Speed, Safety, and
ROI.

6.1 The "FOMO vs. FOG" Conflict
Executives suffer from FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) on the AI boom, but are paralyzed by

FOG (Fear Of Governance)—legal risks, data leaks, and PR disasters.
●​ Penn's Strategy: He resolves this conflict via the 5P Framework. By emphasizing Policy
and Process first, he gives executives the "safety rails" they need to indulge their FOMO.
He essentially sells "Safe Speed."

6.2 The Demand for "Deterministic" Results
A major trend identified in Penn's recent work is the client dissatisfaction with the
"hallucinations" of probabilistic AI. Clients want deterministic outcomes (2+2=4), but AI gives
probabilistic answers (2+2 is probably 4).
●​ Penn's Strategy: He explicitly trains clients on when not to use AI. His "Stop Wasting
Time on AI" thesis advocates for using traditional code (deterministic tools) for math and
logic, and AI only for language and creativity. This "Anti-Hype" stance builds immense
credibility with technical buyers who know AI's limits.15

6.3 The Upskilling Imperative
Companies are terrified of their workforce becoming obsolete. They need training that is
practical, not theoretical.
●​ Penn's Strategy: His workshops are "hands-on-keyboard." Attendees don't just listen;
they build. This aligns with the L&D (Learning & Development) budgets of major
corporations looking to upskill staff rather than fire and re-hire.21

7. Competitive Landscape and Landscape Analysis
The "AI Speaker" market is fiercely competitive. Penn competes in a "Red Ocean" of thought
leaders. We analyze his position relative to three distinct competitor archetypes.

7.1 Competitor Archetype A: The "Community Builder"
Primary Competitor: Paul Roetzer (Marketing AI Institute)
●​ Positioning: Roetzer focuses on the human impact of AI. His brand is "More Intelligent,
More Human." He runs the MAICON conference, creating a massive community moat.16
●​ Philosophy: "AI will not replace marketers; marketers who use AI will replace those who
don't." Focuses on ethics, responsibility, and "AI for Good."
●​ Comparison:
○​ Roetzer: Strategic, Human-Centric, Community-Led. Fees: $15k-$25k.24
○​ Penn: Technical, Data-Centric, Code-Led. Fees: $20k-$35k.
○​ Dynamic: Coopetition. They frequently collaborate, with Penn often serving as the
"Technical Keynote" at Roetzer's strategic conference.25

7.2 Competitor Archetype B: The "Silicon Valley Insider"
Primary Competitor: Zack Kass (Ex-OpenAI)
●​ Positioning: "I was there." Kass leverages his tenure as Head of GTM at OpenAI to
provide "behind the curtain" insights. His narrative is "The Next Renaissance"—optimistic,
macro-visionary, and focused on societal abundance.5
●​ Comparison:
○​ Kass: Visionary, Prestige, "Blue Sky." Fees: $50k-$75k.27
○​ Penn: Practitioner, Utility, "Muddy Boots." Fees: $20k-$35k.
○​ Dynamic: Divergent. Buyers hire Kass to inspire the Board of Directors. They hire
Penn to train the Marketing Department.

7.3 Competitor Archetype C: The "Technologist/Futurist"
Primary Competitor: Cathy Hackl (Spatial Dynamics)
●​ Positioning: "Godmother of the Metaverse." She focuses on Spatial Computing (VR/AR),
gaming, and the convergence of physical/digital worlds. Her brand is highly visual and
"tech-glam".28
●​ Comparison:
○​ Hackl: Visual, Hardware-focused (Apple Vision Pro), Trends. Fees: $30k-$50k.29
○​ Penn: Textual/Data, Software-focused (LLMs), Analytics. Fees: $20k-$35k.
○​ Dynamic: Minimal overlap. Hackl wins purely innovation/trend-focused gigs; Penn
wins operational/data-focused gigs.

8. Strategic Framework I: SWOT Analysis
Strengths (Internal)
●​ Technical Integrity: Penn reads the white papers and writes the code. He can debug a
Python script on stage. This "unimpeachable competence" is his strongest asset against
"fluff" speakers.3
●​ Owned Media Empire: The Almost Timely newsletter (300k+ subs) provides immunity
against social algorithm changes. It is a direct-to-consumer distribution channel of
immense value.2
●​ Proprietary IP: The 5P Framework and Trust Insights brand provide a structured
methodology that creates consulting stickiness beyond the keynote.10
●​ Data-Driven Operations: Penn "dog foods" his own product, using AI to analyze his
newsletter growth, creating a recursive loop of improvement.18

Weaknesses (Internal)
●​ Key Person Dependency: The brand is Christopher Penn. While Trust Insights has Katie
Robbert, the speaking/newsletter revenue is heavily tied to Penn’s personal output and
health.
●​ Complexity Barrier: His content can be intimidatingly technical ("vector embeddings,"
"Markov chains"). This alienates non-technical buyers looking for simple "hacks" or
inspiration.
●​ Visual Aesthetics: Compared to the polished, high-fashion branding of competitors like
Cathy Hackl, Penn’s brand is utilitarian and "engineer-chic."

Opportunities (External)
●​ Agentic AI Services: The shift to "Deep Research Agents" creates a new, high-margin
service line: building automated intelligence units for clients.9
●​ Corporate Governance Training: As regulations (EU AI Act) tighten, demand for "AI
Compliance" workshops will skyrocket. Penn is well-positioned to lead this via his "Data

Privacy" focus.31
●​ Global Expansion: With strong existing recognition, expanding the workshop model to
EMEA/APAC (exemplified by the London workshop) represents significant revenue
growth.21

Threats (External)
●​ Model Commoditization: If AI models become easy enough for a layman to use
perfectly, the need for an "interpreter" like Penn diminishes.
●​ The "Slop" Fatigue: As the internet fills with low-quality AI content ("slop"), brands may
recoil from AI entirely, reducing demand for AI marketing services. Penn must
aggressively position himself as the anti-slop solution.32
●​ Platform Risk: Reliance on third-party models (OpenAI/Google). If these vendors change
their API pricing or terms (e.g., forbidding consulting use), it could disrupt Trust Insights'
service delivery.

9. Strategic Framework II: Porter’s Five Forces
1.​ Threat of New Entrants (High): The barrier to being an "AI Speaker" is a LinkedIn
profile. Penn’s Defense: Provenance. He uses his 2013-era AI work as a shield. "I was
doing this before it was cool." This history cannot be forged.
2.​ Bargaining Power of Buyers (Medium): Corporate budgets are tight, but AI is a
strategic imperative. Buyers have power but are desperate for guidance. Penn’s Defense:
ROI Focus. By tying AI to "Performance" (The 5th P), he aligns with the CFO’s office, not
just the Creative Director.
3.​ Bargaining Power of Suppliers (Moderate): Penn depends on model providers
(OpenAI, Anthropic). Penn’s Defense: Model Agnosticism. He refuses to marry one
vendor, demonstrating proficiency in Llama (Meta), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini
(Google) equally.3
4.​ Threat of Substitutes (High): Free YouTube tutorials, internal training, or "Big Tech"
vendor reps (e.g., a Google rep speaking for free). Penn’s Defense: Customization. A
Google rep will only sell Google. Penn sells the truth, even if it hurts Google. This
"Third-Party Objectivity" is valuable.
5.​ Competitive Rivalry (High): The "AI Expert" space is a Red Ocean. Penn’s Defense:
Niche Down. He has retreated from "General AI" to "Data Science AI." By becoming
more technical, he reduces the pool of direct rivals.

10. Strategic Framework III: BCG Matrix Analysis
●​ Stars (High Growth, High Share):
○​ "Deep Research" Workshops: The concept of using AI agents for competitive

intelligence is exploding. Penn is an early mover here.9
○​ In-Person Keynotes: Post-pandemic, the demand for live connection remains high.
Penn’s fees are robust.
●​ Cash Cows (Low Growth, High Share):
○​ Trust Insights Retainers: Steady, recurring revenue from long-term clients needing
analytics maintenance.
○​ The Newsletter: A stable engine for ad revenue and lead gen.
●​ Question Marks (High Growth, Low Share):
○​ Custom AI Agent Development: Building software/agents for clients. This is high
growth but puts a consultancy in competition with software dev shops. Can Trust
Insights scale this?
●​ Dogs (Low Growth, Low Share):
○​ Legacy Social Listening: The old "keyword cloud" social media monitoring is dead.
Penn has largely abandoned this for AI-driven sentiment analysis.

11. Strategic Recommendations
To secure market leadership through 2026, the following strategic pivots are recommended:

11.1 The "Deep Research" Pivot
Penn should double down on Agentic Deep Research as his flagship service.
●​ Rationale: Executives are drowning in data but starving for intelligence. "Deep Research"
agents (automated by AI) solve this directly. Penn’s ability to architect these agents 9 is a
massive differentiator against "prompt jockey" competitors.
●​ Action: Launch a specific "Deep Research for the C-Suite" product—a high-ticket service
where Trust Insights configures a private agent to monitor a client’s competitors 24/7.

11.2 The "Language Model Optimization" (LMO) Thesis
Traditional SEO is dying due to AI Overviews.4 Penn advocates for LMO—optimizing content
so it is ingested by LLMs.
●​ Recommendation: Position Trust Insights as the premier "LMO Agency." Help brands
audit their presence in the training data of GPT-5 and Claude. This is a "Blue Ocean"
service that no traditional SEO agency can offer.

11.3 "Radical Transparency" as a Marketing Strategy
Continue the strategy of publishing the "Secret Sauce."
●​ Rationale: In a low-trust world, transparency is the ultimate currency. By showing the
exact code and prompts used to achieve results, Penn proves he is not a charlatan. This

effectively "de-positions" competitors who hide behind vague proprietary methodology.

12. Implementation Workplan (12-Month Roadmap)
Phase 1: Infrastructure & "Mise en Place" (Months 1-3)
●​ Newsletter Growth Ops: Implement the "AI Analysis" loop for the Almost Timely
newsletter to optimize subject lines and send times, targeting the 400k subscriber
milestone.2
●​ Agent Development: Finalize the "Trust Insights Deep Research Agent" internal tool.
Test it on own data.
●​ Content Audit: Update all courseware to reflect "Agentic" workflows rather than just
"Chatbot" workflows.

Phase 2: Product Expansion (Months 4-6)
●​ Launch LMO Service: Formally announce "Language Model Optimization" audits for
enterprise clients.
●​ Workshop Tour: Execute the "Generative AI for [Vertical]" roadshow (e.g., Tourism, B2B
Sales), leveraging the synthetic data sets developed for the London workshop.33
●​ Partnership: Deepen ties with the Marketing AI Institute (Roetzer) to co-create an
"Advanced Practitioner" track at MAICON 2025.

Phase 3: Market Dominance (Months 7-12)
●​ The "Agentic" Keynote: Roll out a new flagship keynote for the 2026 season focused
exclusively on "The Agentic Workforce" and "Managing Digital Employees."
●​ Scale Consulting: Hire/Contract junior data scientists to handle the implementation of
the "Deep Research" agents, freeing Penn to focus on R&D and speaking.
●​ Book Launch: Publish a compiled "Field Guide to Agentic AI" based on the newsletter
content to cement authority in the new epoch.
Conclusion:
Christopher S. Penn is uniquely positioned to dominate the "Technical Implementation" lane of
the AI market. As the industry moves from wowing audiences with magic to working with
engineering precision, his brand equity increases. By executing on the transition to Agentic AI
and leveraging his "Open Kitchen" transparency, he can effectively block new entrants and
capture the highest-value segment of the enterprise market: the pragmatic, anxious executive
who needs a guide, not a guru.
